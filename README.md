  # Raspberry-Pi-3-Altium-Template

This Project should simplifiy the design process of modules for raspberry pi 2 and 3, model B.
It uses the 40 pin GPIO connector to access the rpi GPIOs. The dimensions of the board are based on the image below which comes from the raspberry pi developers. 

However I can not ensure the correctness of the design, since it was not produced in the moment (but in the future). Use it as it is without any guarantee from me. If you find a mistake please let me know it :)

Here is a preview on how it looks in 3D, on top of an raspberry pi.
